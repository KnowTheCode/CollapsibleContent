# Collapsible Content Plugin

This repository contains the 4 part series for the [Collapsible Content Plugin](https://knowthecode.io/labs/collapsible-content-plugin) hands-on code building project on [Know the Code](https://KnowTheCode.io).  Each part of this series builds a portion of the completed plugin.  However, each part is a fully functional, ready to use in your project plugin.

The Collapsible Content WordPress plugin allows you to show and hide content using jQuery and CSS. Itâ€™s commonly used in Q&A, FAQ, hints, captions, bios, and extra content reveals. 

The four part series teaches you deeply about WordPress, custom plugin development, jQuery, PHP, and more:

1. Part 1 provides you with a fully functional custom plugin with 2 shortcodes.
2. Part 2 - you'll add a FAQ custom post type, taxonomy, archive template, and shortcode.
3. Part 3 - You'll make the plugin more reusable by re-architecting it to the ModularConfiguration design pattern.
4. Part 4 - You'll convert this plugin from procedural to OOP.
