# Template for more themes

Our FAQ module has a `template-faq.php` file that works with only the Genesis framework.  What if you wanted to use it with other themes, such as Twenty Seventeen, _s, and others?

Each theme and/or theme framework uses their own template and HTML markup structures.  Some handle all the components of a web page within other files, such as the Genesis and Beans frameworks.  Many others handle it directly within the theme itself, such as Twenty Seventeen and _s.

Building an archive for every single possible theme combination is not feasible. 

This enhancement shows you how to adapt the module to allow more themes.  It has files for:

- any Genesis-powered theme
- Twenty Seventeen

It's a starting point to give you the flexibility you want to build more theme-centric archive templates.
